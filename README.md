# youtube-network-analysis

In this repository you can find my team's work for our Machine Learning for Network Sciences course project.

The aim of the project is to analyse YouTube's network, performing link prediction and clustering with the final goal of
* Understanding how the platform recommendation system work
* Verifying whether or not the assigned video category is a good approximation of how video cluster together
